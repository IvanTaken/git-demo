You call me up
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you

You call me up
Just to say
You think we're better off this way
Leaves may fall
Seasons change
Yet we remain

You`re the bets! Take your 100 bucks!

All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
